# Multisign Tool in C

`multisig` is a CLI tool written supporting both single and multisig signatures of arbitrary data leveraging [BIP-Schnorr](https://github.com/sipa/bips/blob/bip-schnorr/bip-schnorr.mediawiki) and [Musig](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/068).

## Dependencies

`multisig` requires Bitcoin-Core's well proven cryptographic library [bitcoin-core/secp256k1](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1). However, until the BIP-Schnorr functionality in [PR #558](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/558) has been merged, we are using [BlockchainCommons/secp256k1-schnorrsig](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/secp256k1-schnorrsig). The secp256k1 library is licensed under the [MIT License](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/blob/master/COPYING).
